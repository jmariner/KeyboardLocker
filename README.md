A simple keyboard locking program written in C and AutoHotkey.

lib\KeyboardLockerAHKU32.bin is a modified AHK interpreter BIN file that contains overridden and custom icons for this program. This removes the need to distribute any .ico files with this software. For development purposes, the icons have been included in the ico folder.
